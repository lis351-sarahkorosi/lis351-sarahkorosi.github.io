        <p> Life wouldn't be complete without doing the things you love during your down time! For me, I like to fulfill my time by practicing the guitar, finding new music to listen to, and bartending! 
        </p>
        <h3> BACKGROUND </h3>
            <h4> Hastings High School Alumni (2023) </h4>
                <p> My high school experience brought me to where I am today. I was able to discover my passion for math and science from all the classes I took and teachers I was lucky enough to have! </p>
            <h4> New York University Langone Health Research </h4>
                <p> Factors Affecting Outcomes of Surgical Interventions for Occlusive Isolated Popliteal Artery Disease. My research included shadowing vascular surgeries, working with a NYU Langone medical student, and reading and conducting data through SVS. 
                </p>

                        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFm5FUxnCwjJk-HY602VvZgkpDLiqyEEVFwJb7D_G94/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Link to Research Paper</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <h3 class="music"> CURRENT </h3>
            <h4> Information Science, B.S. </h4>
                 <p> I am planning on obtaining a bachelor's of science degree in information science. I personally love looking past being able to solve something, and extend to why a problem works out the way it does to better my understanding. That is why this particular major interests me, as information science looks more at the analytical side of technology. </p>
            <h4>Pre-Health</h4>
                <p> A major goal of mine after I graduate is attending medical school. My research project really enlighted me and made me determined to understand medical terms to the same extent as the doctors I was surrounded by. Furthermore, I want be part of helping people in the world any way I can, and knowing the importance of people's physical health, espeically since both of my parents were doctors, I hear a calling to enter this particular field.  </p>
