        <p> Life wouldn't be complete without doing the things you love during your down time! For me, I like to fulfill my time by practicing the guitar, finding new music to listen to, and bartending! 
        </p>
        <h3> BARTENDING </h3>
        <p>I have been bartending weekly ever since September 2024, at Whiskey Jacks Saloon, located at 552 State Street, Wisconsin, Madison. I was able to obtain my Wisconsin bartending license as well as my New York bartending license in July 2024. It is such a exciting experience, not only because of all the recipes I have discovered, but I have met a large range of amazing people, from my co-workers to customers. I have always had a passion to bartend and be able to create all kinds of different mixtures. I find it so fascinating that there are millions of unique ways to create the classic cocktails everybody knows, depending on the location and the person.</p>

        <h3 class="music"> MUSIC </h3>
        <h4> Guitar </h4>
        <p> I have been playing the guitar for around 4 years. Although it is not my strongest instrument, I find it incredible how much knowledge comes with a singular instrument. Playing the guitar helps me feel more tranquil and only focus on the present moment. It is really a great instrument to know!</p>
        <h4> WSUM (Radio) </h4>
        <p> Recently, I decided to join UW Madison's local radio station WSUM 91.7 FM Madison to host my own music show with my friend every week! Although I am still in training currently, I am excited to show others the type of music I love, and also gain new music interests myself! </p>
        <h4> Spotify </h4>
        <p> Although this is less of a hobby, I love listening to music myself and creating new playlists every few weeks. I love knowing that there are beyond billions of songs in the world, so finding new music often is a process I find exciting! </p>
