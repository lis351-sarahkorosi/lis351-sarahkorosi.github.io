        <p> Vacations are where the best memories are made. I have traveled to quite a few places around the United States, as well as Europe. Here are some beautiful places that will never leave my memory!
        </p>
        <h3> ZÃœRICH, SWITZERLAND </h3>
        <p> My mother, sister, and I traveled to Zurich, Switzerland, and traveled to lots of cities and places nearby in August 2023! This trip was absolutely incredible. We walked a lot, took trollys to the top of mountains, ate incredible food, and laughed a lot. Not only are the people super kind here, but the views are impecable! This trip was an experience I will never forget.  </p>

        <h3> RIVERA MAYA, MEXICO </h3>
        <p> In June 2024, my mom, sister, bestfriend, and I all traveled to Mexico together to a resort I would call my second home. I used to go to this resort every year growing up, so coming back here years later was the most nostalgic and amazing experience. This was a more relaxing and tranquil trip, but much needed espeically after a long year of school. I am forever grateful for this trip and for being able to bring my best friend, McKenna, who's like a second sister to me.
